			Digital preservation is the set of processes and activities that 
			ensure continued access to information and all kinds of records, 
			scientific and cultural heritage existing in digital formats. This 
			includes the preservation of materials resulting from digital 
			reformatting, but particularly information that is born-digital and 
			has no analog counterpart.<br>
The goal 
of digital preservation is the accurate rendering of authenticated content over 
time.
