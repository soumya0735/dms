			Cloud computing is a technology that uses the internet and central 
			remote servers to maintain data and applications. Cloud computing 
			allows consumers and businesses to use applications without 
			installation and access their personal files at any computer with 
			internet access. This technology allows for much more efficient 
			computing by centralizing storage, memory, processing and bandwidth.<br>A cloud 
service has three distinct characteristics that differentiate it from 
traditional hosting. It is sold on demand, typically by the minute or the hour; 
it is elastic -- a user can have as much or as little of a service as they want 
at any given time; and the service is fully managed by the provider (the 
consumer needs nothing but a personal computer and Internet access). Significant 
innovations in virtualization and distributed computing, as well as improved 
access to high-speed Internet and a weak economy, have accelerated interest in 
cloud computing.
